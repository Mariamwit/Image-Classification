# Image-Classification

<h1> Image Classification for a City Dog Show  </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
 A city is hosting a citywide dog show and to help the organize committee with contestant registration, every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information. Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs.Python is used to determine which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs". It also determines how well the "best" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed. The project uses an image classification application using a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges; then using these features to identify objects in the images.  The CNN has already learned the features from a giant dataset. There are different types of CNNs that have different structures (architectures) that work better or worse depending on your criteria. With this project, the three different architectures  are used which are AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet and it is determined which is best for this application.
